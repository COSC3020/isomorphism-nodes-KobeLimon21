# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

Given two graphs, one with 2 vertices and one with 4 vertices. They cannot be isomorphic because they are not one ot one or onto, being that they are not one to one or onto since they do ont have the same amount of nodes it would be impossible to map the nodes to each graph being that there would be two extra nodes. Therefore if two graphs do not have the same number of nodes, they cannot be isomorphic.
